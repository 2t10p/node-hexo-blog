Netflix now have "Friends" in list,

i usually watch this to traing my listen skill,

but sometime, when i need check a not sure word,

i need :

1. pause video

2. switch subtitle to english look what he say

3. switch back to chinese

that was annoying.

until i found a chrome/firefox plugin [NflxMultiSubs](https://github.com/dannvix/NflxMultiSubs)
